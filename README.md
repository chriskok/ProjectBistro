## Future Updates

### Customer Mechanic
- During the main scene, spawn customers to the right of the screen.
- The user will be able to touch the character (or click if on PC) to seat them immediately to a random available seat.

### Public Static BUGS
- There are problems with the probability of customer orders currently. 
- We can serve more food than the user has bought.
- The value of leftover food do not get passed to the Menu scene. 

### Long-Term Goal
- Add a log for all the orders that come in as well as to display other messages we may want the user to see.
- Provide decorations to the restaurant for the user to pick. 
- Add the ability for the player to buy more tiles.
